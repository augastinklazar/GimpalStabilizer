# GimpalStabilizer
This code will create a camera stabilizer that can be used to keep a camera steady even when the user is moving.
The stabilizer uses a PID controller to calculate the necessary adjustments to the servo positions in order to compensate for the user's movements. 
The code is open source, so you can modify it to fit your specific needs.

Camera Stabilizer (Gimbal)

This is an open source project that uses a microcontroller and an IMU sensor to implement a PID controller for smooth and accurate camera movement.

Requirements

STM32 microcontroller
IMU sensor
Servo motors
Breadboard
Jumper wires
Power supply
Instructions
Connect the microcontroller, IMU sensor, and servo motors to the breadboard.
Connect the power supply to the microcontroller.
Upload the code to the microcontroller.
Test the stabilizer by moving the IMU sensor around.

Troubleshooting

If the stabilizer is not working properly, check the following:

Make sure that the connections are correct.
Make sure that the power supply is providing enough power.
Make sure that the code is uploaded correctly.
